## Hi there!

I'm a student developer and primarily code in Go, Python and Java, using SQL for databases. Currently, I am learning Rust as a mid-level systems programming language.

Beware! Many of my projects are hosted on private repos, but you can read brief summaries about them at my [portfolio](https://rhobro.github.io/projects).

## Coding Interests
I am primarily interested in Data Science and AI, which I am teaching myself. I am a firm believer that one has to know how something works to be able to innovate, hence I am teaching myself the maths behind AI as I'm learning.

I love to automate things using code and also enjoy competitive programming, in which I am a novice.
