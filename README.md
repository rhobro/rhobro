You know that all the good projects are on private repositories. Nevertheless, here's some stuff I've made years ago.

## Good projects:

Neighbourhood got robbed. CCTV doesn't work anymore. Making a drone-based deterrent system. The "sentry" uses existing CCTV infrastructure and computer vision to locate intruders. I'm designing it to be efficient enough to run on old phones as well. The "controller" allows me to programmatically control my drone. In this case, it can instruct the drone to fly to the location, start filming and following them while calling the police simultaneously. They won't have seen that coming.

System allowing me to play sound from files or microphone across multiple computers in a network.

Rust crate which interfaces to a decentralised crypto exchange. Using whole shebang in cryptography because it's a Dex. You can guess what I'm using it for :)

Neighbour's cat keeps trying to get into the house. Actually got in one time and hid inside the sofa. Mum's allergic. Making a computer-vision powered cat deterrent which uses sound.

Rapid proxy-switiching privacy alternative to Tor. Used free online proxy lists with a testing system.

Quick app to allow me to sign in and out of school from my phone. Uses geofences for verification.

Kahoot bot :)

Interface to a service allowing me to store unlimited amounts of MP4 video online and stream it anywhere for free anonymously. You can see why I wouldn't release that.
