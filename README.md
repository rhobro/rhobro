You know that all the good projects are on private repositories. Nevertheless, here's a recap of those and the ones I'm working on.

## Good stuff:

(_In development_) Neighbourhood got robbed. CCTV doesn't work anymore. Making a drone-based deterrent system. The "sentry" uses existing CCTV infrastructure and computer vision to locate intruders. I'm designing it to be efficient enough to run on old phones as well. The "controller" allows me to programmatically control my drone. In this case, it can instruct the drone to fly to the location, start filming and following them while calling the police simultaneously. They won't have seen that coming. Long term project - this one.

(_In development_) DIY Ring doorbell using old phone. Using CV to identify those outside, audio to know when lurking and not knocking. Passthrough of peephole video feed.

System allowing me to play sound from files or microphone across multiple computers in a network. Building turned into a giant speaker, basically.

Rust crate which interfaces to a decentralised crypto exchange. Using whole shebang in cryptography because it's a Dex. You can guess what I want to use it for :)

Neighbour's cat keeps trying to get into the house. Actually got in one time and hid inside the sofa. Mum's allergic. Making a computer-vision powered cat deterrent which uses sound.
(_Update: cat died :( so stopped development_)

Rapid proxy-switiching privacy alternative to Tor. Used free online proxy lists with a testing system.

Quick app to allow me to sign in and out of school from my phone. Uses geofences for verification.

Kahoot bot :) (and other random experiments like for 2048, Wordle, rider, pianotiles)

Interface to a service allowing me to store unlimited amounts of MP4 video online and stream it anywhere for free anonymously. You can see why I wouldn't release that.

https://latinvocab.herokuapp.com/ - CLC Latin vocab tester, but Heroku free dyno plan stopped?
