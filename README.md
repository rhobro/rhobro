## Hi there!

I'm a student developer and primarily code in Go, Python and Java, using SQL for databases. Currently, I am currently learning Dart in Flutter for a project which involves a cross-platform app and am also learning Rust as a systems language.

## Coding Interests

One of the ways I like to use code is to solve day to day problems so that I can either do something which I could not do before or to make it more efficient, saving me time. The best part is, that these problems usually cover a wide range of domains, so I learn about different aspects of coding in the process.

I am interested in Data Science and AI, which I am teaching myself. I am a firm believer that one has to know how something works in order to be able to innovate, hence I am learning the maths and statistics behind AI as well.
